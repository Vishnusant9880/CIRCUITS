# SOLAR POWER MONITERING SYSTEM
To create a IoT based Solar monitoring system


**Objectives : -**
•	**Real-Time Monitoring:**  Objective: Provide real-time visibility into the performance of solar panels and the overall solar power system.  Benefits: Enables immediate detection of issues, optimization of energy production, and timely decision-making.
•	**Fault Detection and Diagnostics:**  Objective: Detect and diagnose faults or anomalies in the solar power system.   Benefits: Reduces downtime by allowing prompt identification and resolution of issues, improving overall system reliability.
•	Dust or Soiling Sensors: Optical sensors that can detect the amount of dust or soiling on the surface of the solar panels.
•	Remote Monitoring and Control:
**Remote Access**: Enable remote monitoring and control of solar energy systems, allowing operators to manage and optimize performance from anywhere.    
•	Alerts and Notifications: Provide automated alerts and notifications for system issues or deviations from expected performance, facilitating timely response.
•	User Interface: Provide a user-friendly interface for system operators and end-users to monitor and understand the performance of the solar energy system.


**FEATURES:-**

•	The ESP32 typically comes with a dual-core processor, allowing for efficient multitasking and performance.

•	Integrated Wi-Fi module enables wireless communication, making it suitable for IoT (Internet of Things) applications.

•	The ESP32 is designed to operate with low power consumption, making it suitable for battery-powered devices and applications where power efficiency is crucial.

•	Supports various Wi-Fi protocols (802.11 b/g/n) for wireless communication and Bluetooth protocols for short-range communication.

•	Specifies the range of voltages that the sensor can accurately measure. It's important to choose a module that suits the voltage levels you expect in your application.

•	Specifies the range of current levels that the sensor can accurately measure. It's important to choose a sensor that suits the current levels expected in your application.

•	Servo motors are known for their precise positional control. They can maintain and control their position accurately.

•	Specifies the range of particle sizes that the sensor can detect. Dust sensors may be optimized for specific particle size ranges, such as PM1, PM2.5, or PM10.

•	Indicates how closely the sensor's measurements correspond to the actual particle concentrations. Accuracy is often given as a percentage.

•	The primary feature of a photoresistor is its ability to change resistance in response to changes in illumination. As light intensity increases, the resistance decreases, and vice versa.

•	The primary feature of an LDR is its ability to change resistance based on the intensity of incident light. As the light intensity increases, the resistance decreases, and vice versa.

•	Relays have different contact configurations, including normally open (NO), normally closed (NC), and changeover (CO) or double-throw contacts. These configurations determine how the relay behaves in its normal state and when activated.
